Data Source :

• Since the federal government does not maintain database on school shootings, the
data used for this project was gathered by The Washington Post (TWP).

• TWP used news articles, open-source databases, law enforcement reports, and calls to schools and
police departments to create the database with comprehensive data points on school shooting.

• Data contains information on gunfire which met the TWP violence criteria since the
Columbine High massacre on April 20, 1999.

• Shootings at after-hours events, accidental discharges that caused no injuries to anyone other than
the person handling the gun, and suicides that occurred privately or posed no threat to other children
were excluded.

• The database contains 50 columns and 387 rows.

• The purpose of the data is to identify and record every act of gunfire at k-12 schools.
